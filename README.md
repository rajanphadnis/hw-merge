# Homework PDF Merger
Extremely simple: merges pdfs locally. Only merges PDFs with filenames that are numeric. Merges in increasing order and outputs a merged PDF named ```{parentFolderName}_Responses.pdf```

## Access
Added to right-click menu on Windows by following the key pattern in the registry: ```Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell```
